I have included the java file for three progamming questions.

Question (1). has the file name, SinglyLinkedListReverse.java, 
simply run it and insert the amount of nodes, 
and each node you add will be added as first nodes.

Question(2). has the file name stringReverse.java,
after compiled it will just ask for string put and it will
output the reversed string.

Question(3). has the file name preorderTraversal.java,
after the program is ran, it will display the preorder traversal of the expression.
